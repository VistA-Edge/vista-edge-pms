# VistA-Edge-PMS
This is an Open Source Practice Management System (PMS) integrated with VistA EHR, the Electronic Health Record and Health Information System originally developed by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). This Java based PMS works in Windows and can be interfaced with most VistA versions including WorldVistA, FOIA VistA, OSEHRA, vxVistA, OpenVistA, VistA-Edge etc.

This is the first release of the beta version of the VistA-Edge PMS installables.  This version is fully compatible for use with VistA, but the interface for the integrated use will be released later. This will include the Mirth channels and the VistA patches needed. Hence it can now be tested as an independent system. There are some issues in this version, particularly in the Payment posting screen that are being addressed. The updated code base will be released once these are resolved.

## Features

- **Patient Registration** GUI integrated with VistA
- **Patient Appointment** integrated with VistA
- Encounters in VistA captured to **generate/ print HCFA 1500 forms**
- Can be used independent of VistA as a **standalone Practice Management System**
- **Payment Posting** of EOB and Patient receipts

.. Electronic Claim submission, Scheduling & more in newer versions
